## Code Reference for `Handler` Class

### Introduction

The `Handler` class in Python's asyncio library is designed for asynchronous communication in a node for a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It extends the `asyncio.Protocol` class and is tasked with managing network connections, including SSL/TLS setup, data transmission, and handling of incoming/outgoing messages.

### Constructor

#### `__init__(ip_address: str, port: int, node: Node, initiator: bool, ssl_context: ssl.SSLContext, data: Any, put: bool, get: bool) -> None`

Initializes a `Handler` instance, setting various attributes and methods for handling asynchronous operations.

- **Parameters**:
  - `ip_address` (str): The IP address of the node.
  - `port` (int): The port number to be used.
  - `node` (Node): The node object.
  - `initiator` (bool): A flag to indicate whether this instance is an initiator.
  - `ssl_context` (ssl.SSLContext): The SSL context for the connection.
  - `data` (Any): The data to be sent, if any.
  - `put` (bool): A flag for put operations.
  - `get` (bool): A flag for get operations.

### Methods

#### `connection_made(transport: Transport) -> None`

**Description**: Called when a connection is successfully established.

- **Parameters**:
  - `transport` (Transport): The transport object representing the connection.

---

#### `data_received(data: bytes) -> None`

**Description**: Handles incoming data and checks against TCP streaming issues.

- **Parameters**:
  - `data` (bytes): The received data in bytes.

---

#### `handle_response(data: bytes) -> Coroutine`

**Description**: Asynchronously handles the response message.

- **Parameters**:
  - `data` (bytes): The received data to be handled.

---

#### `close_connection() -> None`

**Description**: Closes the current active connection.

---

#### `start_periodic_check() -> None`

**Description**: Starts a periodic liveness check for the node.

---

#### `connect_node(host: str, port: int, initiator: bool) -> Coroutine`

**Description**: Asynchronously connects to a node.

- **Parameters**:
  - `host` (str): The host to connect to.
  - `port` (int): The port to connect to.
  - `initiator` (bool): Whether this instance is an initiator.

---

#### `connect_node_callback(host: str, port: int, initiator: bool = False) -> Coroutine`

**Description**: Asynchronous callback to establish a connection with a node.

- **Parameters**:
  - `host` (str): The host to connect to.
  - `port` (int): The port to connect to.
  - `initiator` (bool, optional): Whether this instance is an initiator. Defaults to False.

---

#### `put_connection(host: str, port: int, msg: Any) -> Coroutine`

**Description**: Establishes an asynchronous connection for put operations.

- **Parameters**:
  - `host` (str): The host to connect to.
  - `port` (int): The port to connect to.
  - `msg` (Any): The message to be sent.

---

#### `get_connection(host: str, port: int, msg: Any) -> Coroutine`

**Description**: Establishes an asynchronous connection for get operations.

- **Parameters**:
  - `host` (str): The host to connect to.
  - `port` (int): The port to connect to.
  - `msg` (Any): The message to be sent.

---

#### `load_ssl_context(host: str, port: int) -> ssl.SSLContext`

**Description**: Loads the SSL context for secure connections.

- **Parameters**:
  - `host` (str): The host for which the SSL context is being loaded.
  - `port` (int): The port for which the SSL context is being loaded.
